This file contains the html/css code for a start-up design studio website. (unfinished)

Created in Visual Studio Code, this one-pager website contains a fixed header with navigational anchor links to four sections; about us, prices, projects and contact. javascript smooth-scrolling effect was added in order to make the website more user-friendly and responsive. 

HEADER.

fully customizable: color, font, height, navigation links, title (h1). border is removable, logo image removable/replaceable. 
 
ABOUT US. (unfinished)

this section has sufficient space to write about the people behind the company. fully customizable. would later on add an image of the owners and/or company instagram feed wrapper.

PRICES. (unfinished)

This is where the prices and what services come with each price should go. place for three columns.

PROJECTS. (unfinished)

photogrid is completely customizable, you can add or delete rows and columns to your liking. in the future, images would have an overlay fade-in animation with title of the project, that would link to seperate project pages with more information and images.
